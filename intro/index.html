href="#Conformal-field-theory" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The conformal field theory (CFT) is one of the central topics of modern physics. It refers to a field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations that preserve the angles between vectors. In spacetime dimension <span>$d&gt;2$</span>, the global conformation symmetry is generated by translation, rotation (in Euclidean signature, or Lorentz transformation in Lorentz signature), dilatation (scale transformation), and special conformal transformation (SCT). These transformations altogether form a group <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d+1,1)$</span>. The CFT operators must carry an irreducible representation of the conformal group. In particular, each operator must carry a <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d)$</span> spin under the rotation, a scaling dimension <span>$\Delta$</span> under dilatation. A special kind of operators that are invariant under SCT called « primaries » deserve particular attension. By acting the space derivatives on the primaries, the « descendants » are obtained. The conformal symmetry is the maximal spacetime symmetry that a field theory can have. The CFT is gives powerful prediction about the property of the field theory. In particular, conformal symmetry uniquely determines the form of two-point and three-point correlation functions. The three-point correlators contain a universal coefficient called the OPE coefficient <span>$f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}$</span> between three primary operators <span>$\Phi_i,\Phi_j,\Phi_k$</span>. The collection of scaling dimensions and the OPE coefficients <span>$\{\Delta_{\Phi_i},f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}\}$</span> are called the CFT data. With this knowledge, an arbitrary correlation function of a CFT can be calculated. </p><p>The CFT has provided important insights into various fields of theoretical physics. In condensed matter physics, it has produced useful prediction about the critical phenomena. Many classical and quantum phase transitions are conjectured to be have emergent conformal symmetry in the IR. The universal critical exponents are directly determined by the scaling dimensions of the primary operators. <em>E.g.</em>, in Ising transitions that spontaneously break <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetry, most critical exponents are given by the scaling dimensions of the lowest <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-odd operator <span>$\sigma$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-even operator <span>$\epsilon$</span>, such as</p><p class="math-container">\[\eta=2\Delta_\sigma-1\qquad\nu=\frac{1}{3-\Delta_\epsilon}\]</p><p>The CFT is also closely related to string theory and quantum gravity high energy physics. In the string theory, The CFT is known to describe the 2d worldsheet ; in quantum gravity, the gravity theory in <span>$(d+1)$</span>-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in the bulk is conjectured to be dual to a <span>$d$</span>-dimensional CFT on the boundary. Moreover, CFT has revealed some fundamental structures in the quantum field theory like the renormalisation group (RG) flow. It has been first discovered that there exists a <span>$c$</span>-function in 2d CFTs that is non-increasing along the RG flow and its value coincides with the central charge at conformal fixed points. Later, people have proven that there exist similar quantities in 3d and 4d CFTs, called the <span>$F$</span>-function and <span>$a$</span>-function. </p><p>In 2d CFTs, besides the global conformal symmetry <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$</span>, there also exists an infinite dimensional local conformal symmetry. Altogether, they form the Virasoro algebra. The infinite dimensional conformal algebra has made many theories exactly solvable, especially the rational theories including the minimal models and the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theories. On the other hand, going to the higher dimensions, the CFTs are much less well-studied due to a much smaller conformal group. The existing methods include numerical conformal bootstrap and Monte Carlo lattice simulations. Numerical boostrap makes use of the global symmetry, consistency conditions such as reflection positivity, and a certain amount of assumptions to bound the conformal data. It has achieved great success in 3d Ising, <span>$\mathrm{O}(N)$</span> Wilson-Fisher, Gross-Neveu CFTs, <em>etc.</em> On the other hand, one can study a CFT by constructing a lattice model that goes through a phase transition in the corresponding universality class, and study the phase transition by Monte Carlo simulation. The extraction of universal data usually involves complicated and expensive finite-size scaling, and only the lowest few CFT operators can be accessed in this way. Among these higher dimensional CFTs, we especially focus on <span>$d=3$</span>, as many Lagrangians in <span>$d\ge 4$</span> flow to free theories. </p><h3 id="Fuzzy-sphere"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Fuzzy-sphere">Fuzzy sphere</a><a id="Fuzzy-sphere-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Fuzzy-sphere" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In addition to these existing approaches, the <em>« fuzzy sphere regularisation »</em> has recently emerged as a new powerful method to study 3d CFTs. The idea is to put an interacting quantum Hamiltonian on a 2-sphere <span>$S^2$</span>. This geometry preserves the full rotation symmetry (on the contrary, lattice models often only preserve a discrete subgroup). Moreover, when the system is tuned to a critical point or critical phase, combined with the time evolution direction, the system is described by a quantum field theory living on a generalised cylinder <span>$S^2\times\mathbb{R}$</span>, a manifold that is conformally equivalent to flat spacetime through the Weyl transformation</p><p class="math-container">\[    (\hat{\mathbf{n}},\tau)\in S^2\times\mathbb{R}\ \longmapsto\ r\hat{\mathbf{n}}\in\mathbb{R}^3,\qquad r=e^{\tau/R}\]</p><p>where <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere. This conformal transformation maps each time slice of the cylinder to a cocentric sphere in the the flat spacetime. </p><p>Thanks to the conformal flatness that is not owned by other manifolds (<em>e.g.</em>, a lattice model with periodic boundary condition lives on the manifold <span>$(S^1)^d$</span> which is not conformally flat), we can make use of some nice properties of the conformal field theory, the most important one of which is the state-operator correspondance. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the critical Hamiltonian on the sphere and the CFT operators. The state and its corresponding operator has the same <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin and representation under global symmetry. More importantly, as the Weyl transformation maps the Hamiltonian <span>$H$</span> corresponding to the time translation on the cylinder to the dilatation <span>$D$</span> on the flat spacetime, the excitation energy of a state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator <span>$\Delta_\Phi$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi\]</p><p>where <span>$E_0$</span> is the ground state energy, <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere, and <span>$v$</span> is the speed of light that is dependent on the microscopic model and is the same for different states. With this property, one can obtain the scaling dimensions simply by obtaining the energy spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian without doing complicated finite size scalings, and one can obtain the OPE coefficients simply from the matrix element of a one-point correlator. This process will be described below.</p><p>A quantum Hamiltonian on a sphere enjoys the full rotation symmetry and the property of state-operator correspondence. However, it is difficult to put a lattice on the sphere due to the curvature (in particular the non-zero Euler characteristic), especially to recover an <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span>-symmetric theomodynamic limit. An alternative way we take is to fuzzify the sphere. We consider free charged particles moving on a sphere with a magnetic monopole with a flux <span>$4\pi s$</span> (<span>$s\in\mathbb{Z}/2$</span>) placed at its centre. The monopole exerts a uniform magnetic field on the sphere, which modifies the single particle Hamiltonian and the single particle eigenstates. Now the single particle eigenstates form highly degenerate spherical Landau levels. The lowest Landau level has a degeneracy <span>$(2s+1)$</span>. By setting the single particle gap to be the leading energy scale, adding interactions, and projecting onto the lowest Landau level, we obtain a finite Hilbert space. For the sake of numerical simulation, the system is analoguous to a length-<span>$(2s+1)$</span> spin chain with long range interaction, where different Landau level orbitals behave like the lattice sites. The difference is that the <span>$(2s+1)$</span> orbital forms a spin-<span>$s$</span> representation of the <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation group, and in this way the continuous rotation symmetry is preserved. The word « fuzzy » means the non-commutativity, in our case, due to the presence of magnetic field. The non-commutativity provides a natural length scale which serves as a UV regulator of the quantum field theory. The radius of the sphere scales as <span>$R\sim\sqrt s$</span>. The thermodynic limit can be taken as <span>$s\to\infty$</span>, and we then recover a regular sphere without non-commutativity. </p><p>The power of this approach has been first demonstrated in the context of the 3D Ising transition, where the presence of emergent conformal symmetry has been convincingly established and a wealth of conformal data has been accurately computed. The study has then been extended to accessing various conformal data such as the OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic <span>$F$</span>-function, conformal generators in the 3d Ising CFT, studying conformal defects and boundaries such as the magnetic line defect, various conformal boundaries in 3D Ising CFT, and realising various 3d CFTs such as Wilson-Fisher CFTs, <span>$\mathrm{SO}(5)$</span> deconfined criticality, <span>$\mathrm{Sp}(N)$</span> symmetric CFTs, <em>etc.</em> In the following sections, we shall review the existing works, technical details and the numerical methods. </p><h2 id="Review-of-existing-work"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Review-of-existing-work">Review of existing work</a><a id="Review-of-existing-work-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Review-of-existing-work" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In this section, we review the existing work related to fuzzy sphere. </p><h5 id="The-pioneering-work-[[Zhu-2022](@ref-References)]"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-pioneering-work-[[Zhu-2022](@ref-References)]">The pioneering work [<a href="#References">Zhu 2022</a>]</a><a id="The-pioneering-work-[[Zhu-2022](@ref-References)]-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-pioneering-work-[[Zhu-2022](@ref-References)]" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>This paper first proposes the idea of fuzzy sphere and apply it to the simplest example of 3d Ising CFT. The paper constructs a model with two flavours of fermions that resembles the spin-up and spin-down in the lattice transverse-field Ising model. At half-filling, one can morally think that a spin degree of freedom lives on each orbital. The Hamiltonian contains a density-density interaction that resembles the Ising ferromagnetic interaction and a polarising terms that resembles the transverse field. By tuning the ratio of the two terms, a transition between quantum Hall ferromagnet (a two-fold degenerate state where one of the two flavours are completely occupied) and paramagnet (a one-fold degenerate state where the superpositions of the two flavours at each orbital are occupied) occurs. This transition spontaneously breaks a <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetry and falls into the Ising criticality. The paper then make use of a unique feature of spherical models described by CFT –- state-operator correspondence –- at the critical point to extract the scaling dimensions of the scaling local operators. The paper finds evidence for conformal symmetry, including that (1) there exists a conserved stress tensor with <span>$\Delta=3$</span> (which is used as the calibrator), and (2) all the levels can be classified into conformal multiplet where the spacing between operators&#39; scaling dimensions are very close to integer. This is one of the first numerical evidence that 3d Ising transition has emergent conformal symmetry. More remarkably, the scaling dimensions of primaries such as <span>$\sigma,\epsilon,\epsilon&#39;$</span> are already very close to the most accurate known value by numerical bootstrap with an error within <span>$1\%$</span> at a small system size <span>$N_m=16$</span>, which is comparable to a <span>$4\times4$</span> lattice system. The structure of Ising CFT operator spectrum already starts to show up at an even smaller system size <span>$N_m=4$</span>. All these clues point towards a curious observation that fuzzy sphere suffers from a remarkably small finite-size effect. </p><p>This seminal paper opens a new avenue for studying 3d conformal field theories. After that, most of the researches on fuzzy sphere roughly fall into three catagories (with several exceptions) :</p><ol><li><p>Accessing various conformal data, </p></li><li><p>Realising various 3d CFTs, and</p></li><li><p>Studying conformal defects and boundaries.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Accessing-various-conformal-data"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Accessing-various-conformal-data">Accessing various conformal data</a><a id="Accessing-various-conformal-data-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Accessing-various-conformal-data" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The first direction is to develop methods to calculate various data and quantities of 3d CFTs on fuzzy sphere. Typically, these methods are tested on the simplest example of 3d Ising CFT. For many of those CFT data, fuzzy sphere is the first non-perturbative method to access them ; for the others, the fuzzy sphere has achieved great consistency with previous methods such as quantum Monte Carlo and conformal bootstrap. So far, the accessible CFT data include operator spectrum, OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic <span>$F$</span>-function and conformal generators. </p><h5 id="OPE-coefficients-[[Hu-2023Mar](@ref-References)]"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#OPE-coefficients-[[Hu-2023Mar](@ref-References)]">OPE coefficients [<a href="#References">Hu 2023Mar</a>]</a><a id="OPE-coefficients-[[Hu-2023Mar](@ref-References)]-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#OPE-coefficients-[[Hu-2023Mar](@ref-References)]" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>Apart from the operator spectrum that has been studied in <a href="#References">Zhu 2022</a>, a wealth of CFT data can be obtained from the local operators. This paper studies the local observables on the fuzzy sphere, including the density operators and certain four-fermion operators. These observables can be expressed as the linear combination of CFT local scaling operators. After a finite size scaling that takes into account the data from different system sizes, the subleading contribution can be substracted and only the leading contribution are left. This includes the lowest primaries in Ising CFT in each symmetry sector : <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-odd <span>$\sigma$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-even <span>$\epsilon$</span>. The OPE coefficients are then evaluated by taking the inner product of a fuzzy sphere local observable with two CFT states <span>$\langle\Phi_1|\Phi_2(\hat{\mathbf{n}})|\Phi_3\rangle$</span>. This paper computes 17 OPE coefficients of low-lying CFT primary fields with high accuracy, including 4 that has not being reported before. The rest are consistent with numerical bootstrap results. Also remarkably, this paper start to apply DMRG to the fuzzy sphere. The maximal system size is increased from <span>$N_m=18$</span> by ED to <span>$N_m=48$</span> by DMRG.</p><h5 id="Correlation-functions-[[Han-2023Jun](@ref-References)]"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Correlation-functions-[[Han-2023Jun](@ref-References)]">Correlation functions [<a href="#References">Han 2023Jun</a>]</a><a id="Correlation-functions-[[Han-2023Jun](@ref-References)]-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Correlation-functions-[[Han-2023Jun](@ref-References)]" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>In addition to the OPE coefficients, the local observable can also be used to calculate correlation functions. By taking the inner product of two local observables (density operators) at a time displacement <span>$\langle\Phi_1|\Phi_2(\hat{\mathbf{n}}_0)\Phi_3(\hat{\mathbf{n}},\tau)|\Phi_4\rangle$</span> with two CFT states, a general four-point function can be calculated. This piece of CFT data in practice cannot be derived from the rest. This paper calculates this four-point function in 3d Ising CFT with DMRG. A non-trivial check of conformality, the crossing symmetry, is verified for the correlator <span>$\langle\sigma\sigma\sigma\sigma\rangle$</span>. The special case –- two-point functions by taking <span>$\Phi_1=\Phi_4=\mathbb{I}$</span> –- are also studied and compared with the expected results by conformal symmetry. </p><h5 id="Entropic-F-function-[[Hu-2024](@ref-References)]"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Entropic-F-function-[[Hu-2024](@ref-References)]">Entropic <span>$F$</span>-function [<a href="#References">Hu 2024</a>]</a><a id="Entropic-F-function-[[Hu-2024](@ref-References)]-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Entropic-F-function-[[Hu-2024](@ref-References)]" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>Beyond the correlators of local operators, a wealth of information can be learnt from the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum. A remarkable quantity is called the <span>$F$</span>-function, which is defined through the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, consider a quantum system that is described by a CFT and lives on <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span>. A circle with radius <span>$R_d$</span> divides the system into inner part <span>$A$</span> and outer part <span>$B$</span>. The entanglement entropy is defined and expected to scale with <span>$R_d$</span> as </p><p class="math-container">\[    S_A(R_d)=\operatorname{tr}_A\rho\log\rho=\alpha R_d/\delta-F\]</p><p>where <span>$\delta$</span> is a UV-regulator. The constant part is known as the <span>$F$</span>-function of a 3d CFT. The <span>$F$</span>-function is proved to be RG-monotonic, <em>i.e.</em>, along a renormalisation group flow from UV to IR, the value of <span>$F$</span>-function is non-increasing, analogous to the central charge in 2d CFTs. Despite its importance, it has never been calculated before through non-perturbative approaches in interacting 3d CFTs. This paper has performed the first non-perturbative computation of <span>$F$</span> function for paradigmatic 3d Ising CFT on fuzzy sphere. The sphere is cut in the real space into two crowns along a latitude circle <span>$\theta$</span>, and the entanglement entropy <span>$S_A(\theta)$</span> as a function of <span>$\theta$</span> is calculated. The <span>$F$</span>-function is extracted from the <span>$S_A(\theta)$</span> in vicinity of the equator, and the result yields <span>$F_A=0.0612(5)$</span> after a finite size scaling.</p><h5 id="Conformal-generators-[[Fardelli-2024](@ref-References),-[Fan-2024](@ref-References)]"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Conformal-generators-[[Fardelli-2024](@ref-References),-[Fan-2024](@ref-References)]">Conformal generators [<a href="#References">Fardelli 2024</a>, <a href="#References">Fan 2024</a>]</a><a id="Conformal-generators-[[Fardelli-2024](@ref-References),-[Fan-2024](@ref-References)]-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Conformal-generators-[[Fardelli-2024](@ref-References),-[Fan-2024](@ref-References)]" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>Within the generators of conformal symmetry, the <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation and the dilatation are manifest and act as rotation and time translation on fuzzy sphere. The rest two, <em>viz.</em> translation <span>$P^\mu$</span> and special conformal transformation (SCT) <span>$K^\mu$</span> needs to be emergent in the IR at the conformal point but broken along the RG flow. It is worthwhile to construct these IR generators by the UV operators on fuzzy sphere. These papers invest in such construction with the help of stress tensor <span>$T^{\mu\nu}$</span>. The time component <span>$T^{\tau\tau}$</span> of stress tensor equals the Hamiltonian density <span>$\mathscr{H}$</span> and integrates into the generator <span>$\Lambda^\mu=P^\mu+K^\mu=\int\mathrm{d}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\,n^\mu\mathscr{H}$</span>. The action of this generator send a scaling operator to other operators in the same multiplet with the number of partial derivatives increased or decreased by one. These papers calculate the matrix elements of the generators <span>$\Lambda^\mu$</span> and compare it with the theoretical value in CFT and find good agreement, which is another non-trivial verification of conformal symmetry.

The most straightforward approach is to extract the scaling dimensions from the energy spectrum through the state-operator correspondence. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and the CFT operators. The state and its corresponding operator has the same <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin and representation under flavour symmetry, and the excitation energy of a state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator <span>$\Delta_\Phi$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi\]</p><p>where <span>$E_0$</span> is the ground state energy, <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere (here we take <span>$R=\sqrt{N_m}$</span>), and <span>$v$</span> is the model-dependent speed of light. The constant <span>$v/R$</span> can be determined through a calibration process, <em>i.e.</em>, comparing the spectrum to some known properties of a CFT spectrum. The criteria to determine the conformal symmetry include </p><ol><li><p>The existence of a conserved stress tensor <span>$T^{\mu\nu}$</span>. The stress tensor is the symmetry current of the translation transformation. It is known to be a singlet under the flavour symmetry, have spin-2 under <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation and scaling dimension exactly <span>$\Delta_{T^{\mu\nu}}=3$</span>.</p></li><li><p>The existence of a conserved flavour symmetry current <span>$J^\mu$</span> if there is a continuous flavour symmetry. The symmetry current typically lives in the antisymmetric rank-2 tensor representation of the flavour symmetry. <em>E.g.</em>, if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{U}(1)$</span>, then the symmetry current has charge-0 ; if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{O}(3)$</span>, then the symmetry current has spin-1 and is odd under the improper <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> transformation ; if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{O}(n)$</span> (<span>$n\ge 4$</span>) or <span>$\mathrm{SU}(n)$</span> (<span>$n\ge 3$</span>), then the symmetry current lives in the antisymmetric rank-<span>$2$</span> tensor representation. </p></li><li><p>The organisation of the operator spectrum into conformal multiplets. All the levels in the spectrum of a CFT can be organised into the conformal primaries and their descendants. The descendants live in the same representation under the flavour symmetry as the primary, and the difference between the scaling dimensions of a primary and its descendant is an integer. Specifically, for a scalar primary <span>$\Phi$</span>, its descendants have the form <span>$\Box^n\partial^{\mu_1}\partial^{\mu_2}\dots\partial^{\mu_l}\Phi-\textrm{(trace)}$</span> (<span>$n,l=0,1,2,\dots$</span>) with <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin-<span>$l$</span> and scaling dimension <span>$\Phi+2n+l$</span>, where <span>$\Box=\partial_\mu\partial^\nu$</span>. For a spinning primary <span>$\Phi^{\mu_1\dots\mu_s}$</span>, its descendants has the two forms : <span>$\Box^n\partial^{\nu_1}\dots\partial^{\nu_m}\partial_{\rho_1}\dots\partial_{\rho_k}\Phi^{\rho_1\dots\rho_{k}\mu_1\dots \mu_{s-k}}$</span> (<span>$k=0,\dots,s$</span>, <span>$n,m=0,1,\dots$</span>) with scaling dimension <span>$\Delta_\Phi+k+m+2n$</span> and <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin-<span>$(s-k+m)$</span>, and <span>$\Box^n\partial^{\nu_1}\dots\partial^{\nu_m}\partial_{\rho_1}\dots\partial_{\rho_k}\epsilon^{\sigma}{}_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\nu}}\partial^{\tilde{\nu}}\Phi^{\rho_1\dots\rho_{k}\tilde{\mu}\mu_1\dots \mu_{s-k-1}}$</span> (<span>$k=0,\dots,s-1$</span>, <span>$n,m=0,1,\dots$</span>) with scaling dimension <span>$\Delta_\Phi+k+m+2n+1$</span> and <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin-<span>$(s-k+m)$</span>. For the second form, the fully antisymmetric tensor <span>$\epsilon$</span> alters the parity.</p></li></ol><p>The most convenient way of determining the coefficient <span>$v/R$</span> is by utilising criteria 1 or 2 :</p><p class="math-container">\[    \frac{v}{R}=\frac{E_{T^{\mu\nu}}-E_0}{3}\quad\textrm{or}\quad\frac{E_{J^\mu}-E_0}{2}\]</p><p>Alternatively, one can define a cost function that depends on the tuning parameter and the speed of light and compares the scaling dimensions obtained from fuzzy sphere and the prediction by conformal symmetry. <em>E.g.</em>, for the Ising CFT, the tuning parameters are the pseudopotentials <span>$\{U_i\}$</span> and the transverse field <span>$h$</span>. The criteria for conformal symmetry we use include the stress tensor <span>$T^{\mu\nu}$</span> and the descendants <span>$\partial^\mu\sigma$</span>, <span>$\partial^\mu\partial^\nu\sigma$</span>, <span>$\Box\sigma$</span>, <span>$\partial^\mu\epsilon$</span>.

Note that this optimal point depends on the system size. In order to do finite size scaling, if the CFT describes a phase transition, one could fix all but one parameters at the optimal point in the largest accessible system size and tune the last parameter to determine the critical point through a finite size scaling. </p><h3 id="Local-observables"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Local-observables">Local observables</a><a id="Local-observables-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Local-observables" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>We have introduced how to determine the scaling dimensions from the energy spectrum.
